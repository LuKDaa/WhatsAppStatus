---> Hello! Welcome to my first repository and public code! <---

With this JS script you can have a timeline of a contact's status on WhatsApp (WEB ONLY!).

You just have to copy the content of "WhatsAppCode.js" and paste it into your browser's console, to access it you must press F12 and in the console section enter it 
(If it is the first time you enter a command, you must follow the instruction that the console asks you to enable the pasting of codes).

These same states are shown in the console in real time.

For it to work properly, you must keep the tab open and focused on the chat.

If you want to stop monitoring the status just write "stopMonitoring()", then a file will be saved that shows all the states with each time indicated.

If you liked or found this repository useful, please consider supporting it.
Thank you very much!
